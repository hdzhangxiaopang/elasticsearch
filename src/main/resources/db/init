Extract it to our current directory and letâ€™s load it into our cluster as follows:

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XPOST "localhost:9200/bank/_doc/_bulk?pretty&refresh" --data-binary "@accounts.json"
curl "localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v"


And the response:

health status index uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
yellow open   bank  l7sSYV2cQXmu6_4rJWVIww   5   1       1000            0    128.6kb        128.6kb

Which means that we just successfully bulk indexed 1000 documents into the bank index (under the _doc type).
